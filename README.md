## class Notes

- .gitignore is the lisot of files that will be ignored by git
- we want node_modules to be ignored because of the larger folder size
- When we collaborate with other devs, we clone the repository WITHOUT the node_modules and then we run 'npm i' to install the node_modules

- Generators like express-generator will create the boilerplate framework code for us, and then we run 'npm i' to download the list of dependencies
